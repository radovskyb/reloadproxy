`reloadproxy` is a simple Go application that's a reverse proxy to your Go server. It also does cool stuffs. (See gif below)

Anytime your files are updated or any files are added or deleted, `reloadproxy` automatically
restarts your server and displays your changes in real time in your browser.

`reloadproxy` is just a hacked up prototype at the moment so don't expect too much :)
So far it's only been tested on my MacBook Pro so if it works for you too then awesome.
